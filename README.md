## Abstract

Web applications have been highlighted as an aid for communication and logistical needs of individuals in refugee camps, as well as for entertainment values. Understanding how to better support these needs from a data-driven perspective is the primary focus of this study. Web application usage data was collected from the Cisco Meraki Dashboard at frequency, in active hours, and quantity, in kilobytes, for six Greek refugee camps. Previous qualitative findings for social networking web application were supported from this dataset by showing quantitative proof for four of the thirteen social networking web applications. In addition, the social networking data in this study mirrors the rank for the social networking web applications found in the UNHCR DIST and ADP report. As the refugee situation continues to grow, so does the significance of understanding their connectivity needs.
